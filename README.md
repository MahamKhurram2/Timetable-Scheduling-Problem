# Timetable Scheduling Problem

This project solves the classical university timetable scheduling problem using a genetic algorithm.

## Problem Description
The problem involves assigning time slots to each section, in a particular room, taught by a professor, ensuring minimum clashes between sections, professors, and rooms.

## Constraints
The scheduling must follow several hard and soft constraints, such as room availability, professor teaching capacity, class duration, and lab session requirements.

## Features
- Uses genetic algorithms (selection, crossover, mutation) for solving the timetable assignment.
- Supports hard constraints like room size, professor assignments, and session schedules.
- Attempts to meet soft constraints like minimizing floor traversal and maximizing teaching time continuity.
